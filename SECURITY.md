Enhanced Security Policy
This repository contains the source code for a MySQL CRUD API built using Express.js. The security of this application and its data is paramount.

Key Security Principles:

Secure Coding Practices: Adherence to secure coding standards and best practices.
Input Validation: Rigorous input validation using express-validator to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).
Authentication and Authorization: Secure password hashing with Argon2, rate limiting with express-rate-limit to mitigate brute-force attacks.
Data Encryption: Consider encrypting sensitive data (e.g., passwords) if necessary.
Error Handling: Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information.
Dependency Management: Regular updates and security checks for dependencies (express, cors, dotenv, mysql2, argon2, express-rate-limit, express-validator).
Security Testing: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
Specific Security Measures:

Password Storage: Passwords are securely hashed using Argon2 with a high number of iterations to protect against brute-force attacks.
Input Validation: All user-provided inputs are carefully validated to prevent injection attacks, including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
Rate Limiting: API requests are rate-limited to mitigate brute-force attacks and other malicious activities.
Error Handling: Error messages are carefully crafted to avoid revealing sensitive information.
CORS: CORS is configured to allow only authorized origins, preventing cross-origin attacks.
